# CREATE BACKEND FOR REALTIME CHAT USING NODEJS

## INTRODUCE
The backend of this real-time chat application is built with Node.js, a popular platform for server-side development with JavaScript. Below are the key details about the backend:

## Architecture and Technologies
- **Node.js**: A platform for server-side JavaScript development.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for Node.js.

## Features
### User Registration and Login
- **Registration**: Users can register for an account with a unique username and a secure password. The application uses hashing (e.g., bcrypt) to ensure password security.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in using their username (email) and password. The application authenticates users to ensure a secure login process.
- **Session Management**: The backend uses cookie-based sessions to maintain user login states, allowing users to stay logged in across browser sessions.

### Group Chat and Conversation Management
- **Creating Group Chats**: Authenticated users can create new group chats, providing a name and adding initial members.
- **Managing Conversations**: Users can start new conversations in a group chat or with individual users. The backend keeps track of conversations in the database for persistent storage.
- **Real-Time Messaging (Upcoming Feature)**:
  - **Planned Development**: We are working on implementing real-time messaging, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly within group chats and individual conversations.
  - **Technology**: This feature will leverage Socket.IO for real-time communication, enabling seamless interaction between users in real-time.

### Security and Data Protection
- **Authentication**: The application authenticates users, ensuring only registered users can access chat features.
- **Authorization**: Authorization logic is implemented to ensure users can only access their own data and manage their own group chats.
- **Secure Sessions**: Cookie-based sessions with secure and httpOnly flags are used to maintain security in user sessions.
